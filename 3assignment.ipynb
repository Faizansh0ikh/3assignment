    "1. **Execution Model**: Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, where each process has its own memory space and runs independently. In contrast, multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parallelism**: Multiprocessing achieves true parallelism by utilizing multiple processors or CPU cores. Each process runs on a separate core, enabling concurrent execution of tasks. On the other hand, multithreading achieves concurrency by interleaving the execution of multiple threads within a single process. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, multithreading cannot achieve true parallelism in CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Consumption**: Multiprocessing generally consumes more system resources compared to multithreading. Each process has its own memory space, and context switching between processes incurs overhead. In multithreading, threads share the same memory space, and context switching between threads is faster and consumes fewer resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Isolation**: In multiprocessing, each process runs independently in its own memory space. If one process crashes or encounters an error, it does not affect other processes. In multithreading, all threads within a process share the same memory space, so an error or exception in one thread can potentially affect the stability of other threads within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Communication and Data Sharing**: In multiprocessing, communication and data sharing between processes typically require explicit mechanisms like inter-process communication (IPC) or shared memory. This is because processes have separate memory spaces. In multithreading, communication and data sharing between threads are more straightforward since they share the same memory space. However, proper synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores are necessary to handle concurrent access to shared data and prevent race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scalability**: Multiprocessing can scale better when it comes to utilizing multiple CPU cores or processors. Each process can run on a separate core, allowing for better parallelism. Multithreading, due to the GIL, may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores in CPU-bound tasks. It is more suitable for IO-bound tasks or situations where parallelism is not the primary concern."
